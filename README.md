# Using Spotify data to predict which "Novidades da semana" songs would become hits
## Evaluation of the accuracy of Random Forest, Logistic Regression and SVM.

Spotify is my favorite digital music service and I'm very passionate about the potential of to extract meaningful insights from data. Therefore, I decided to do this article to consolidate my knowledge of some classification models and to contribute to the study of other beginners in Data Science.

I constructed a dataset with approximately 2755 hit and non-hit songs and extracted their audio features using the Spotipy library. I tested three classification models (Random Forest, Logistic Regression and SVM) and choose the model with the best accuracy to predict what new songs would be hits.
